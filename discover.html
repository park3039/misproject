                    <h3>Why I Chose UMD</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose the University of Minnesota, Duluth because of a good scholarship opportunity and the diversity of the school. Coming from a very small school with essentially no diversity, I wanted a school that would allow me to branch out and see what else there was out there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also chose Duluth because of the amazing outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and the beach. UMD is also one of the only schools in the area that have a program that integrates marketing and graphic design, which was exactly what I was looking for in my education.

                    <h3>Duluth Highlights</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my time living in Duluth, I've come to deeply appreciate the natural beauty and quiet moments that define the area. Some of my most memorable experiences include watching the northern lights brighten the night sky and spending time outdoors with friends, whether exploring local trails or relaxing by the water. I've especially enjoyed Duluth's shoreline, there's something relaxing about starting or ending the day by the beach, watching the sunrise or sunset over Lake Superior.
