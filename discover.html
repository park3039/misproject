                    <h3>Why I Chose UMD</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose the University of Minnesota, Duluth because of a good scholarship opportunity and the diversity of the school. Coming from a very small school with essentially no diversity, I wanted a school that would allow me to branch out and see what else there was out there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also chose Duluth because of the amazing outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and the beach. UMD is also one of the only schools in the area that have a program that integrates marketing and graphic design, which was exactly what I was looking for in my education.
