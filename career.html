                        <p>
                            Walser Automotive Group's Marketing Internship program offers exactly what I'm looking for in an internship experience. The opportunity to work on a specific project throughout the internship and present it directly to the CEO is incredibly appealing. This structure allows interns to take ownership of their work while gaining exposure to executive-level decision making. The company's commitment to hearing ideas from younger generations shows they value fresh perspectives and innovation.

                        <p>
                            While I recognize that this internship is typically geared toward students after their senior year, I'm actively building the qualifications needed for this opportunity. My Marketing and Graphic Design dual major provides a strong foundation in both strategic thinking and creative execution. I'm developing skills in project management, presentation design, and strategic analysis that will make me a competitive candidate when I'm ready to apply.

                        <p>
                            My skills align well with Walser's needs for innovative marketing solutions. My graphic design background allows me to create compelling visual presentations, while my marketing coursework provides the strategic framework for developing effective campaigns. My experience with project-based learning and presentation skills will be valuable assets for this internship structure.

                            My dual major in Marketing and Graphic Design positions me well for Hormel's diverse marketing needs. I can contribute to both the strategic planning and creative execution of marketing campaigns. My understanding of consumer psychology and visual communication will be valuable for brand management initiatives. As I complete more marketing courses, I'll be even better prepared to contribute to their advertising and pricing strategy projects.
